## the graph with the ideal and actual signals in ensemble C.

## an explanation of the functions compute_tuning_curves, compute_response, and run_neurons at a conceptual level. That is, explain in your own words what the inputs and outputs of those functions are, and how they are computed. You do not have to explain gain and bias, these are properties of the neurons, defining their exact responses to input.
