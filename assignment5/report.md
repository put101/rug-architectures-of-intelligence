# Report

## A screenshot in which you show values (right click, Value) for ensembles a, b, and c, and a two-dimensional value for ensemble d (XY-value) while running your model, demonstrating the effects of the various connections that you made.

## A screenshot of the tuning curves of ensemble a (right click on a, Details…, Plots). Explain what those tuning curves indicate.

## Set the stimulus to 0 (right-click on the stimulus, 'Set value...' – it will ignore the sine function) . Explain the pattern that you see in the value displays of a, b, and c.
