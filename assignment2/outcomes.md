In a separate pdf file, show the outcomes of your model in a table or a figure, (i.e., what reaction times it predicts) and answer the following questions: 


## The reaction times produced by your subitizing model will probably not fit the human reaction times perfectly. In what way(s) do they differ from each other? Discuss absolute deviation of the reaction times, as well as the general pattern of times.


## Why doesn't your model fit the data perfectly? That is, what do people do differently from your model?
